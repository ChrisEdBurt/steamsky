            <p>Steam Sky is an open source roguelike with a steampunk setting. You are a
commander of a flying ship, as leader you will be traveling across floating
bases, engaging in combat, trading goods etc. The game is more strategy
based than tactical like most of roguelikes. There is no mandatory ending
to this game, you may freely play until your character die. The game is
currently under heavy development, but is in a playable state. Steam Sky is
available on Linux and Windows 64 bit platforms.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buy cheaply, sell expensive: find best trade routes between sky bases.</p>
<p>Each base type sell other items. Some bases even only buy items. Prices of
items in bases depends on bases types. For example, it is good idea to buy
food in agricultural bases and sell it to industrial bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do randomly generated missions to gain money and reputation at sky bases.</p>
<p>Patrol selected map areas, explore unvisited areas, deliver items to bases,
etc. Some missions may require some free cargo space, others may depends on
installed ship modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage your ship's crew: give them orders, hire new ones or dismiss old
members.</p>
<p>Your crew and your character must eat and drink. Wounded, hungry or tired
crew members works slower. As crew members spend some time on given order
he or she will gain experience in selected skill which allow works faster
or more precise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage your ship: upgrade installed modules, install new ones, or repair
damaged ones.</p>
<p>Progress in game depends on installed ship modules. With stronger modules,
you have bigger chance to meet stronger enemies. You must balance your
progress between gaining experience by crew members and installing new,
better ship modules. Or some day, you meet too strong enemy for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craft items: from tools through repair materials to food.</p>
<p>At start you know only few basic crafting recipes. New recipes may be
bought from bases or discovered by deconstructing items. Better crafter can
craft more items from this same amount of materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fight with enemy ships in tactical combat.</p>
<p>Give orders to your crew at begining of each combat round and watch result
when turn passed. Change ship speed, position of ship in combat or give
your gunners orders to attack selected part of enemy ship. Take down
enemies armor to board they ships for melee combat for even better loot. If
enemy is too strong for you, you can try escape from combat too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your game, your way: change the game to your own style.</p>
<p>Almost everything in the game can be changed, added or removed via data
files, which are plain XML files. Add new &quot;races&quot; (factions), change
existing ships (their statistics, crew or cargo) or remove &quot;professions&quot;
(careers). Items and crafting recipes can be changed too. Even interface
can be tweaked to your needs.</p>
