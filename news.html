               <p>All known bugs in stable version was fixed which means: time for new stable release tomorrow (in around 24 hours after this post). We will see how many bugs will be found this time.</p><p>In development version this week was mostly upgrades to the game factions (races).</p><ul><li>Undead faction members was definitely too weak (especially player when selected them as the starting faction). They gained two things: natural armor which allow them to reduce damage taken in melee combat. Second thing is special toxic attack when they attack unarmed and target is not immune to diseases (most other factions members). In that situation, Undead can do a lots more damage. There still is some work to balance this faction but I should finish it in next week.</li><li>Drones got this same special thing: natural armor which reduce damage in melee combat.</li></ul><p>All special "abilities" of factions are represented as flags thus they are very easy to add/remove to others or new factions, especially that almost all game data are in XML files.</p>Additionally, development version got as usual, few bug fixes, few new bugs and few new NPC ships.</p><p>During tests I was once bit funny situation: during combat my Undead ship against Inquisition, I was sent my whole crew as boarding party on enemy ship. When we arrived, I noticed that there is only one enemy (should be 4). By the moment I was thinking that something is wrong with game data, but then I reminded myself: rest of enemy crew was set AI to boarding either. So, when I boarded them, they are boarded my own empty ship :) This ended in two different melee combats (first on enemy ship then back on my own).</p>

               <p>After few weeks of postpone for later, it is, finally, shiny, etc, etc just one ugly 4 mins video of new UI of the game: <a href="https://vimeo.com/322418460">https://vimeo.com/322418460</a> created by very inexperienced in making videos person, me :)</p><p>And back to the more interesting things - changes in game :)</p><p>First of all: release new stable version worked perfect as trap for new bugs - few appeared almost instantaneous. Well, at least there will be some reason to release another stable version :)</p><p>In development version I was probably finished fun with UI for this released. Unless I will get some crazy ideas again :) As wrote above, effect of this work is visible on the video.</p></p>Probably much more important information: completely redesigned how battering rams works in ship's combat. Earlier this weapon was very unhandy and weak, now it is changed:</p><ul><li>Good news: now damage from battering ram depends not only on it, but on speed and the mass of the ship. Thus first attack in combat, when both ships going closer to self may be very powerful. With good hit probably big ship should destroy small one in one hit.</li><li>Bad news: battering rams now attack only every 2 rounds in combat - this weakening was needed to not made battering ram too powerful. Because there is one more thing</li><li>Probably good news again: battering ram now works like something between normal guns and harpoon guns. It made damage plus when it hit unarmored target, it stopping it, allowing to send to other ship boarding party. This should be really good change especially for players who choice Undead faction (their starting ships are equipped only in battering rams).</li></ul><p>Thus now we have 3 types of weapon in ship's combat: pure damage (guns), control (harpoon guns) and hybrid (battering rams). This should made ship's combat little more interesting.</p><p>And as usual, added few new NPC ship prototypes to the game and replaced some old bugs by new :)</p>
